## 5. What is a CloudFormation stack?

A stack is a collection of AWS resources that you can manage as a single unit. In other words, you can create, update, or delete a collection of resources by creating, updating, or deleting stacks. All the resources in a stack are defined by the stack's AWS CloudFormation template.

## 6. What is not a security best practice?

Root access should not be used and should have MFA enabled

## Cloud Practitioner, Question 7:

You would like to decouple your application components from demand. What service would you use?

Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) offers a reliable, highly-scalable hosted queue for storing messages as they travel between applications or microservices. It moves data between distributed application components and helps you decouple these components.

## Cloud Practitioner, Question 8:

You have an application that sends push messages to mobile devices. Which service should you use?

SNS can send push notifications See: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sns/latest/dg/SNSMobilePush.html

## Cloud Practitioner, Question 9:

Design for failure and nothing will fail, is a best practice?

Rule of thumb: Be a pessimist when designing architectures in the cloud; assume things will fail. In other words, always design, implement and deploy for automated recovery from failure. See: https://media.amazonwebservices.com/AWS_Cloud_Best_Practices.pdf

## Cloud Practitioner, Question 10:

What is Amazon Redshift?



## Cloud Practitioner, Question 11:

You would like to compare costs between AWS and onsite physical servers. What service is best to use?

See: awstcocalculator.com

## Cloud Practitioner, Question 12:

You would like to estimate the costs of a project on AWS. What service is best to use?

See: https://calculator.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html

## Cloud Practitioner, Question 13:

You would like to investigate where costs are being wasted. What service is best to use?

See: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awsaccountbilling/latest/aboutv2/cost-explorer-what-is.html

## Cloud Practitioner, Question 14:

The only difference, other than price, between On-Demand instances and Spot Instances is that Spot instances can be interrupted by EC2 with two minutes of notification when the EC2 needs the capacity back.

See: https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/spot/

## Cloud Practitioner, Question 15:

An online resource to help you reduce cost, increase performance, and improve security by optimizing your AWS environment, _________ provides real time guidance to help you provision your resources following AWS best practices.

See: https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/trustedadvisor/

## Cloud Practitioner, Question 16:

_________ is an automated security assessment service that helps improve the security and compliance of applications deployed on AWS. It automatically assesses applications for vulnerabilities or changes from best practices.

See: https://aws.amazon.com/inspector/

## Cloud Practitioner, Question 17:

Your users keep forgetting the account ID for logging in to the console. How can you help them?

If you want the URL for your sign-in page to contain your company name (or other friendly identifier) instead of your AWS account ID, you can create an alias for your AWS account ID.

See: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/console_account-alias.html

## Cloud Practitioner, Question 18:

What is a best practice for IAM user access?

When you create IAM policies, follow the standard security advice of granting least privilege—that is, granting only the permissions required to perform a task.

See: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/best-practices.html#grant-least-privilege

## Cloud Practitioner, Question 19:

A _________ tells Auto Scaling when and much to scale. You can create a _________  based on the occurrence of specified conditions (dynamic scaling) or you can create one based on a specific schedule.

A scaling plan tells Auto Scaling when and how to scale. For example, you can base a scaling plan on the occurrence of specified conditions (dynamic scaling) or on a schedule. An autoscaling policy defines how to scale and how much scaling to be applied. A scaling plan will reference a scaling policy.

## Cloud Practitioner, Question 20:

What happens, by default, when one of the resources in a CloudFormation stack cannot be created?

By default, the “automatic rollback on error” feature is enabled. This will cause all AWS resources that AWS CloudFormation created successfully for a stack up to the point where an error occurred to be deleted. This is useful when, for example, you accidentally exceed your default limit of Elastic IP addresses, or you don’t have access to an EC2 AMI you’re trying to run. This feature enables you to rely on the fact that stacks are either fully created, or not at all, which simplifies system administration and layered solutions built on top of AWS CloudFormation.

## Cloud Practitioner, Question 21:
Amazon CloudFront is a global content delivery network (CDN) service that securely delivers data, videos, applications, and APIs to your viewers with low latency and high transfer speeds from ________ around the World.

​You connect to your EC2 Windows instance using RDP. You connect to your EC2 Linux instance using SSH.

## Cloud Practitioner, Question 27:

It is best practice to use the instance store available for your EC2 instance to store temporary data.

An instance store provides temporary block-level storage for your instance. This storage is located on disks that are physically attached to the host computer. Instance store is ideal for temporary storage of information that changes frequently, such as buffers, caches, scratch data, and other temporary content, or for data that is replicated across a fleet of instances, such as a load-balanced pool of web servers.

See: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/InstanceStorage.html

## Cloud Practitioner, Question 28:

Spot Instances run until either you terminate them or the Spot Price increases above your bid price.

## Cloud Practitioner, Question 29:

An EC2 security group acts as a firewall that controls the traffic allowed to reach one or more instances.

See: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/using-network-security.html

## Cloud Practitioner, Question 30:

You have an application that requires ad-hoc data mining and analytics of manufacturing data. What is best suited for this application?

Amazon EMR is a managed cluster platform that simplifies running big data frameworks, such as Apache Hadoop and Apache Spark, on AWS to process and analyze vast amounts of data. By using these frameworks and related open-source projects, such as Apache Hive and Apache Pig, you can process data for analytics purposes and business intelligence workloads.

See: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/emr/latest/ManagementGuide/emr-what-is-emr.html

## Cloud Practitioner, Question 31:

Your company has a backup policy that requires data to be accessible within seconds for the first 6 months and archived with up to a day to access after 6 months. What is the best solution?

See: https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/archive-s3-to-glacier/

## Cloud Practitioner, Question 33:

IAM Groups let you specify permissions for a collection of users, which can make it easier to manage the permissions for those users.

An IAM group is a collection of IAM users. Groups let you specify permissions for multiple users, which can make it easier to manage the permissions for those users. 

See: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_groups.html

## Cloud Practitioner, Question 34:

You're creating an application that runs on an AWS EC2 instance and that makes requests to AWS. You need to create an IAM _____.

You can and should use an IAM role to manage temporary credentials for applications that run on an EC2 instance. When you use a role, you don't have to distribute long-term credentials (such as a user name and password or access keys) to an EC2 instance.

See: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_use_switch-role-ec2.html

## Cloud Practitioner, Question 35:

You have an application that requires collecting data from a voting system and creating real-time metrics and reporting of that data. What is best suited for this application?

Amazon Kinesis Data Streams enables you to build custom applications that process or analyze streaming data for specialized needs. Kinesis Data Streams can continuously capture and store terabytes of data per hour from hundreds of thousands of sources such as website clickstreams, financial transactions, social media feeds, IT logs, and location-tracking events.

## Cloud Practitioner, Question 36:

AWS _____ is a serverless compute service that runs your code in response to events and automatically manages the underlying compute resources for you.

## Cloud Practitioner, Question 45:

With _________, you can send transactional email, marketing messages, or any other type of high-quality content and you only pay for what you use.

See: https://aws.amazon.com/ses/

## Cloud Practitioner, Question 46:

Company B provides an online image recognition service and utilizes SQS to decouple system components for scalability The SQS consumers poll the imaging queue as often as possible to keep end-to-end throughput as high as possible. However, Company B is realizing that polling in tight loops is burning CPU cycles and increasing costs with empty responses. How can Company B reduce the number of empty responses?

Long polling helps reduce your cost of using Amazon SQS by reducing the number of empty responses. You can enable long polling using the AWS Management Console by setting a Receive Message Wait Time to a value greater than 0.

See: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/sqs-long-polling.html

## Cloud Practitioner, Question 47:
